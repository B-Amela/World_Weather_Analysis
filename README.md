# World_Weather_Analysis
 
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a vacation map that allows users to apply weather criteria to identify potential travel destinations. By utilizing Google API's, we also provided the user with recommended hotels and travel destinations.

### Weather Database
Generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and performed an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data  gathered in this module, used  API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city.

### Customer Travel Destinations Map
Used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then used those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Lastly, showed those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

### Travel Itinerary Map
Utilized the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
